# Swarovski Optik OpenAPI Documentation

Welcome to the Swarovski Optik OpenAPI Documentation. Here you will find all
the materials to understand, learn and build Applications that connect to the AX
Visio.

## Quick-Start Guide

The following steps are a quick-start guide to build an Android Application:

0. Get a working [Android Application Developement Setup](https://developer.android.com/get-started),
   own your personal computer. E.g., you need to install [AndroidStudio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
1. Go to Github and clone the
   [openapi-developer-example-app](https://github.com/swarovskioptik/openapi-developer-example-app) repository.
2. Read the [README.md](https://github.com/swarovskioptik/openapi-developer-example-app/blob/master/README.md)
   and add your API key, that you have received from Swarovski Optik, to the gradle project files.
3. Build, deploy and run the application with Android Studio on your smartphone.
4. Follow the instructions on the application's screen. It walks you through the steps to
   connect your smartphone to the AX Visio and start the OpenAPI Inside application.

Congratulations! You have built your first Android Application that uses the
OpenAPI of the AX Visio.
