# Swarovski Optik OpenAPI Documentation

Welcome to the Swarovski Optik OpenAPI Documentation. Here you will find all
the materials to understand, learn and build applications that connect to the
[AX Visio](https://www.swarovskioptik.com/us/en/hunting/products/binoculars/ax-visio).


## Quick-Start Guide

The following steps are a quick-start guide to build an Android Application:

0. Get a working [Android Application Developement Setup](https://developer.android.com/get-started),
   own your personal computer. E.g., you need to install [AndroidStudio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
1. Go to Github and clone the
   [openapi-developer-example-app](https://github.com/swarovskioptik/openapi-developer-example-app) repository.
2. Read the [README.md](https://github.com/swarovskioptik/openapi-developer-example-app/blob/master/README.md)
   and add your API key, that you have received from Swarovski Optik, to the gradle project files.
3. Build, deploy and run the application with Android Studio on your smartphone.
4. Follow the instructions on the application's screen. It walks you through the steps to
   connect your smartphone to the AX Visio and start the OpenAPI Inside application.

Congratulations! You have built your first Android Application that uses the
OpenAPI of the AX Visio.

This was a very short and very brief step by step guide.  You find a more
detailed tutorial here:
[Using the example application](tut/using-the-example-application.md)


## More documentation

Apart from the quick-start guide this website contains a lot more
documentation.  On the left side, you see the navigation menu. It contains an
*explanations* section.  There, you can learn and understand more about the
concepts and functionalities.

The *tutorials* section contains detailed step-by-step guides to walk you
through the process of building and using the example application and
requesting an API key.

The *How-To guides* sections cover in-depth topics to achieve various goals.

And last but not least, the *references* section contains information and
reference material that should help you while you are implementing your own
application ideas.


## Prerequisite

If you want to start developing Android applications for the AX Visio using the
OpenAPI, you need a AX Visio binocular. There is currently no emulator or
sandbox to start development right away on your personal computer.

Please contact [developers@swarovskoptik.com](mailto:developers@swarovskoptik.com)
for the possibility of development devices.


## Support

If you have any further questions or remarks, do not hesitate to contact us.
Just email [developers@swarovskoptik.com](mailto:developers@swarovskoptik.com).
We are looking forward to trying out your app with the AX Visio.


## Documentation in an early stage

The OpenAPI documentation is in an early stage. There is a lot of potential for
improvement. If you have suggestions or feedback, just contact us. We will try to
provide the additional material and updates in a timely manner.
