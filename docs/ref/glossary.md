## OpenAPI Contexts

This name stands for the special `OpenAPIContext` and the `OpenAPIContextBLE`
and the additional contexts that are available for third party apps that are
using the OpenAPI.  The full list of contexts is available at [Introduction -
OpenAPI](../intro/openapi.md).

## Inside vs Outside Applications:

Inside applications run on the AX Visio binocular and can be activated by
rotating the mode selection wheel. Outside Applications run on the users
smartphone and connect via the `SO Comm SDK` to the binocular.
