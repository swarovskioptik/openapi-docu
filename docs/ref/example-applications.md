# Example Applications

Currently there is only a single example application.

## OpenAPI Developer Example Application

This is a minimal Android Application to show the usage of the OpenAPI to
connect to the AX Visio. The application uses only a very small feature of the
OpenAPI. This is intentional. The app should only showcase the necessary steps,
UI screens and code to guide the user

* to grant the necessary Android permissions to the app and enable Bluetooth,
* to connect to the AX Visio using the *SOCommOutsideAPI* library and
* to start the OpenAPI Inside Application with the selection wheel

Only after these setup steps are completed, the OpenAPI contexts and other
contexts can be used.

The code is available at Github in the repo
[openapi-developer-example-app](https://github.com/swarovskioptik/openapi-developer-example-app).
